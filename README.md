# Dungeons & Dragons Monster Dictionary
As a longtime fan of the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game, when I stumbled upon the 5th edition API from dnd5eapi.co I knew I wanted to build something from it. I found their monster data most appealing so I created an app that lists all the monsters in D&D 5e and then display attributes of each monster, depending upon which one was clicked. Eventually I would like to expand the scope and create a module for spells as well.
